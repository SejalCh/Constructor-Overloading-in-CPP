# Constructor-Overloading-in-CPP

##**AIM**:To study about constructor overloading in C++

##**THEORY**:
<p>In C++, two constructors can have the same name if the number and/or type of arguments passed is different.These constructors having the same name but different arguments are known as overloaded constructors.Overloaded constructors have the same name (name of the class) but the different number of arguments. Depending upon the number and type of arguments passed, the corresponding constructor is called.</p><br>

**Syntax**
public class varname{<br>
varname(){<br>
....}<br>
varname(string s){<br>
....}<br>
varname(int i){<br>
....}<br>
...<br>
}

*three overloaded constructors ;they must have different parameters list*
